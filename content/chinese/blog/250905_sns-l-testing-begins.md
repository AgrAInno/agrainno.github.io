🔬 **SNS-L Prototype Enters Field Testing Phase**

We are pleased to announce that our first **Smart Nutrient Sensor (SNS-L)** prototype has officially entered the field testing phase.

After months of development and laboratory validation, SNS-L is now being tested in real agricultural conditions to evaluate its performance across different crop types, growth stages, and environmental conditions.

**What's being tested:**

* Real-time nitrogen content monitoring
* Sensor accuracy and reliability under field conditions
* Wireless data transmission and system integration

This testing phase is crucial for refining the sensor design and ensuring SNS-L meets the practical needs of farmers and agricultural professionals.

Early results are promising, and we look forward to sharing more updates as testing progresses.

**AgrAInno** — bringing precision nutrient prediction from lab to field.
