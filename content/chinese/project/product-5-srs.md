## Satellite-Based Crop Nutrition Monitoring

AgrAInno’s Satellite Data Service provides field-scale insights into crop health, nitrogen status, and stress levels through high-resolution multispectral imagery. Using Sentinel-2 data, our platform delivers timely, cloud-based diagnostics that help farmers and agronomists optimize input use and improve crop performance.

Our AI-enhanced analytics process NDVI and NDRE vegetation indices to detect spatial variability and temporal trends in canopy condition. These maps support precision agriculture by informing variable rate fertilizer application and yield forecasting.

### Features:
- Automated satellite data ingestion and processing
- NDVI/NDRE-based vegetation index monitoring
- Historical and real-time crop health trends
- AI-enhanced anomaly detection

### Benefits:
- Monitor field nutrition and stress remotely
- Optimize input efficiency and reduce costs
- Improve crop management decisions over time
- Scalable from single fields to large operations

AgrAInno’s satellite monitoring solution helps bring data-driven insights to every field—enabling smarter, more sustainable agriculture from above.
