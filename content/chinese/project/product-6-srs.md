## Integrated Satellite & Inno Sensor Mapping

AgrAInno’s integrated service platform combines high-resolution satellite data with ground-truth measurements from Inno Handheld sensors. This dual-source approach enables accurate detection of crop nitrogen levels and early identification of water stress zones—empowering smarter nutrient and irrigation management.

Our AI-driven fusion engine correlates reflectance data from Sentinel-2 imagery with leaf-level spectral data captured by Inno sensors. This allows for the generation of high-confidence maps and time-series insights across growth stages.

### Features:
- Seamless integration of UAV/sensor data and satellite imagery
- NDVI/NDRE vegetation indices validated with in-field sensor data
- Cloud-based processing with AI-enhanced pattern recognition
- Scalable analytics from plot to regional scale

### Benefits:
- Improve fertilizer placement with precision
- Detect water stress and adjust irrigation proactively
- Bridge the gap between remote sensing and actionable agronomy
- Enable large-scale monitoring without sacrificing accuracy

AgrAInno’s AI-Enhanced Satellite & Sensor Integration platform provides a powerful decision-support solution for sustainable, data-driven farming.
