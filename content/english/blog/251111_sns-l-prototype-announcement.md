🌱 **Smart Nutrient Sensor Prototype (SNS-L) Successfully Developed**

We are excited to announce the completion of AgrAInno's first Smart Nutrient Sensor prototype, **SNS-L**, a major step toward real-time, AI-powered nutrient monitoring for precision agriculture.

Built on our optimized NPDI index, SNS-L overcomes the saturation issues of traditional NDVI and delivers more reliable nitrogen diagnostics across crop growth stages. The prototype integrates: 

* Selected multispectral components
* A custom compact optoelectronic filter system
* Real-time NPDI calculation and wireless data transfer
* Seamless integration with automated irrigation/fertilization systems

Initial field validation shows promising performance and confirms the strong potential of SNS-L for accurate, continuous nutrient sensing.

SNS-L now enters the next phase of miniaturization, robustness testing, and pilot deployment with our partner institutions. 

**AgrAInno** — advancing smart agriculture through sensors, AI, and innovation.
