### Welcome to AgrAInno!

We're dedicated to transforming agriculture through advanced AI and sensing technologies. Below you'll find answers to common questions about our products and services. If you need more information, feel free to contact us at info@agrainno.com.

#### 1. What is AgrAInno?

AgrAInno is a research-based agri-tech startup focused on developing smart sensors, AI-powered models, and mobile applications for precision agriculture. Our team of agronomists, engineers, and data scientists has developed proprietary technologies to support sustainable crop nutrient management through real-time, data-driven insights.

#### 2. What products does AgrAInno offer?

We currently offer:
- **SNS-L Smart Nutrient Sensor**: A prototype sensor that measures nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in real-time using our optimized NPDI index
- **AgriWeed App**: An AI-powered smartphone app for fast and accurate weed identification, available on iOS
- **Satellite-based mapping services**: Cloud-based nitrogen and chlorophyll concentration mapping (Premium and Advance packages)
- **Multi-nutrient prediction** (in development): Extended nutrient analysis capabilities for comprehensive crop monitoring

#### 3. How does the SNS-L sensor work?

The SNS-L sensor uses advanced multispectral technology with a custom compact optoelectronic filter system. It measures plant nutrient levels using our optimized NPDI (N Planar Domain Index), which overcomes the saturation issues of traditional NDVI. The sensor provides real-time NPDI calculations with wireless data transfer and can integrate seamlessly with automated irrigation and fertilization systems.

#### 4. What are your pricing packages?

We offer three packages:
- **Basic (€1,999)**: SNS-L sensor measuring nitrogen and chlorophyll, plus smartphone app
- **Premium (€2,499)**: Everything in Basic plus annual cloud-based satellite mapping license
- **Advance (€2,999)**: Everything in Basic and Premium plus annual multi-nutrient prediction license (in development)

#### 5. Is the SNS-L sensor ready for commercial use?

The SNS-L prototype has successfully completed development and is currently in the field testing phase. Initial validation shows promising performance. The sensor is entering the next phase of miniaturization, robustness testing, and pilot deployment with our partner institutions.

#### 6. Where can I download the AgriWeed app?

The AgriWeed app is available on the Apple iOS Store. You can download it here: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/agriweed/id6752901076?l=en-GB
