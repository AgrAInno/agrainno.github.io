## UAV-Based Weed Detection and Mapping

AgrAInno provides cutting-edge drone-based weed mapping solutions to support precision weed management in agriculture. By integrating high-resolution RGB and multispectral imagery with advanced AI models, we generate detailed weed distribution maps that help optimize herbicide applications and improve crop productivity.

Our workflow includes data acquisition using DJI Phantom 4 and P4 Multispectral drones, image enhancement via Super-Resolution techniques, and AI-based segmentation using models such as YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN. These models are trained on annotated datasets derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM)-assisted labeling.

### Key Features:
- UAV data acquisition at 10 m flight height
- Real-time image enhancement with ESRGAN
- AI-powered weed segmentation with high accuracy (mAP50 > 0.9)
- Statistical analysis of weed and fertilizer impact on yield

### Applications:
- Precision herbicide application planning
- Research on weed-crop interactions
- Digital twin generation for field variability analysis

AgrAInno’s UAV mapping solutions are designed to enhance sustainable weed management and support informed agronomic decision-making.
