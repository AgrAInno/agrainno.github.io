## UAV-Based Crop Nutrition and Stress Mapping

AgrAInno’s UAV Health Mapping service offers an advanced solution for monitoring crop nutrition and detecting stress at the field scale. Using drones equipped with multispectral sensors, we collect high-resolution imagery that is enhanced with super-resolution models to produce detailed vegetation indices and nutrient status maps.

Our platform applies state-of-the-art AI algorithms, including YOLOv8 and pixel-level analysis, to identify spatial variability in plant health. This enables timely, site-specific agronomic decisions that improve nitrogen use efficiency and support sustainable practices.

### Features:
- High-resolution aerial imaging using DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral
- Real-ESRGAN-enhanced imagery for precise plant feature detection
- Integration with AI models for chlorophyll and stress detection
- Scalable workflow for large plots and research trials

### Benefits:
- Identify nitrogen deficiency and stress hotspots early
- Optimize fertilizer application zones
- Track treatment effects across time and space
- Improve yield forecasting through spatial crop diagnostics

AgrAInno’s UAV Health Mapping is designed to empower researchers and farmers with actionable data, leading to smarter, greener agricultural systems.
